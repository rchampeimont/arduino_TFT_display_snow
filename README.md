# arduino_TFT_display_snow
A very simple Arduino program to display a snow animation on a TFT screen

I used this hardware:
* Adafruit RA8875 https://www.adafruit.com/product/1590
* Adafruit 7.0" 40-pin TFT Display - 800x480 with Touchscreen https://www.adafruit.com/product/2354 (In this project the touch feature is unused so a display-only like https://www.adafruit.com/product/2353 would also work.)
* Arduino: I tested both Arduino Uno Rev3 and Arduino Wifi Rev2 (which is based on Atmega 4809)

See also the interactive version which uses the touch screen: https://github.com/rchampeimont/arduino_TFT_display_snow_interactive
